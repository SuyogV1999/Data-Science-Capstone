# Data-Science-Capstone
## Introduction

SpaceX is a revolutionary company who has disrupt the space industry by offering a rocket
launces specifically Falcon 9 as low as 62 million dollars; while other providers cost upward
of 165 million dollars each. Much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage.
Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a
launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for
a rocket launch. The goal of this project is to create a machine learning pipeline to predict if
the first stage will land successfully.
